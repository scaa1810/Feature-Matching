Successfully implemented a real-time feature matching system using ORB descriptors and FLANN-based matching algorithm. By integrating RANSAC-based homography estimation, the system achieves robust object tracking with 46.15% inlier ratio (exceeding the Oxford dataset benchmark of 40.92%) while maintaining 32+ FPS performance. The implementation handles complex patterned targets with a reprojection error of 5.60 pixels, well below the 8-pixel threshold for usable tracking applications.

Key technical achievements include custom geometric filtering of feature matches, adaptive ORB parameter tuning based on image content, and homography validation to ensure physically plausible transformations. The clean visualization technique highlights only inlier matching lines for improved clarity, enabling real-time performance assessment through comprehensive metrics display.
